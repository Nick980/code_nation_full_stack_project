    <h1>Classes</h1>
    <h6 class="warrior_text">Warrior <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/Warrior_Crest.webp')}}" alt="Warrior Logo"></h6>
        <h4>Roles: <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/tank.webp')}}" alt="">Tank, <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/dps.webp')}}" alt=""> DPS</h4>
            <p>For as long as war has raged, heroes from every race have aimed to master the art of battle. Warriors combine strength, leadership, and a vast knowledge of arms and armor to wreak havoc in glorious combat. Some protect from the front lines with shields, locking down enemies while allies support the warrior from behind with spell and bow. Others forgo the shield and unleash their rage at the closest threat with a variety of deadly weapons. The warrior’s battle cries embolden friends and leave foes cowering in fear. With legendary precision, warriors target the smallest gaps in armor and slice at hamstrings in a blur of steel.
            <br><br>
            Every dragon slain, corrupted tyrant toppled, and demon banished from Azeroth has trembled in the face of these lords of war</p>
    <h6 class="paladin_text">Paladin <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/Paladin_Crest.webp')}}" alt="Paladin Logo"></h6>
        <h4>Roles: <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/tank.webp')}}" alt="">Tank, <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/healer.webp')}}" alt="">Healer, <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/dps.webp')}}" alt=""> DPS</h4>
            <p>This is the call of the paladin: to protect the weak, to bring justice to the unjust, and to vanquish evil from the darkest corners of the world. These holy warriors are equipped with plate armor so they can confront the toughest of foes, and the blessing of the Light allows them to heal wounds and, in some cases, even restore life to the dead. Ready to serve, paladins can defend their allies with sword and shield, or they can wield massive two-handed weapons against their enemies. The Light grants paladins additional power against the undead and demons, ensuring that these profane beings corrupt the world no longer.
            <br><br>
            Paladins are not only zealots, but also guardians of the righteous, and they bestow blessings on those the Light would shine upon. The Light radiates from paladins, and worthy allies who stand near them are emboldened by its power</p>
    <h6 class="hunter_text">Hunter <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/Hunter_Crest.webp')}}" alt="Hunter Logo"></h6>
        <h4>Roles: <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/dps.webp')}}" alt=""> DPS</h4>
            <p>Hunters know the uncharted places of the world. Gifted with a deep empathy for all life, they have an uncanny knack for befriending wild animals and taming them as pets. In addition, hunters can use their finely honed senses to become master trackers. Wherever hunters go, they fight back the ravages of sickness, exploitation, and industrialization.
            <br><br>
            Hunters are at home in the wilderness and have a special affinity for beasts. They rely on their weaponry and their pet to deal damage.</p>
    <h6 class="rogue_text">Rogue <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/Rogue_Crest.webp')}}" alt="Rogue Logo"></h6>
        <h4>Roles: <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/dps.webp')}}" alt=""> DPS</h4>
            <p>Rogues fend for themselves, looking for fights in which they dictate the terms. They’re the shadows in the night that remain unseen until the right moment comes to strike—then they dispatch an opponent with quick blade work or a deadly toxin snuck acutely into the bloodstream. Rogues are opportunistic thieves, bandits, and assassins, but there’s an unparalleled art to what they do</p>
    <h6 class="priest_text">Priest <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/Priest_Crest.webp')}}" alt="Priest Logo"></h6>
        <h4>Roles: <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/dps.webp')}}" alt=""> DPS, <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/healer.webp')}}" alt="">Healer</h4>
            <p>riests are devoted to the spiritual, and express their unwavering faith by serving the people. For millennia they have left behind the confines of their temples and the comfort of their shrines so they can support their allies in war-torn lands. In the midst of terrible conflict, no hero questions the value of the priestly orders. These masters of the healing arts keep their companions fighting far beyond their normal capacities with an array of restorative powers and blessings. The divine forces at the priest’s command can also be turned against foes, smiting them with holy fury.
            <br><br>
            As light cannot exist without darkness, and darkness without light, some priests tap into shadow to better understand their own abilities, as well as the abilities of those who threaten them</p>
    <h6 class="shaman_text">Shaman <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/Shaman_Crest.webp')}}" alt="Shaman Logo"></h6>
        <h4>Roles: <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/dps.webp')}}" alt=""> DPS, <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/healer.webp')}}" alt="">Healer</h4>
            <p>Shaman are spiritual guides and practitioners, not of the divine, but of the very elements. Unlike some other mystics, shaman commune with forces that are not strictly benevolent. The elements are chaotic, and left to their own devices, they rage against one another in unending primal fury. It is the call of the shaman to bring balance to this chaos. Acting as moderators among earth, fire, water, and air, shaman summon totems that focus the elements to support the shaman’s allies or punish those who threaten them.
            <br><br>
            These masters of the elements can also call upon elemental forces directly, unleashing torrents of lava and bolts of lightning against foes. The elements can create, destroy, support, and hinder. The experienced shaman balances the vast spectrum of these primordial forces into an array of diverse abilities, making shaman versatile heroes and valued members of any group.</p>
    <h6 class="mage_text">Mage <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/Mage_Crest.webp')}}" alt="Mage Logo"></h6>
        <h4>Roles: <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/dps.webp')}}" alt=""> DPS</h4>
            <p>Magi are wizards of immense knowledge and skill. Their obvious physical frailty is deceptive, for they can call upon the cosmic energies of the Twisting Nether. Rarely do magi engage in  combat. Instead, they prefer to attack from a distance, hurling powerful bolts of frost and flame at their unsuspecting enemies.
            <br><br>
            Mages are the iconic magic-users of Azeroth who learn their craft through intense research and study. They make up for their light armor with a potent array of offensive and defensive spells.</p>
    <h6 class="warlock_text">Warlock <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/Warlock_Crest.webp')}}" alt="Warlock Logo"></h6>
        <h4>Roles: <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/dps.webp')}}" alt=""> DPS</h4>
            <p>Warlocks are the bane of all life. Empowered by demonic blood, they can inflict great torment upon their foes. To replenish the dreadful energy their spells expend, warlocks drain vitality from their victims. The warlock can also summon and control terrifying demonic entities. Still, warlocks are feared above all else for their singular wickedness and cruelty.
            <br><br>
            Warlocks cast Fire or Shadow magic to damage, drain, or curse their enemy. They summon demons as servants.</p>
    <h6 class="monk_text">Monk <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/Pandaren_Crest.webp')}}" alt="Monk Logo"></h6>
        <h4>Roles: <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/tank.webp')}}" alt="">Tank, <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/dps.webp')}}" alt=""> DPS, <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/healer.webp')}}" alt="">Healer</h4>
            <p>When the pandaren were subjugated by the mogu centuries ago, it was the monks that brought hope to a seemingly dim future. Restricted from using weapons by their slave masters, these pandaren instead focused on harnessing their chi and learning weaponless combat. When the opportunity for revolution struck, they were well-trained to throw off the yoke of oppression.
            <br><br>
            Masters of bare-handed combat, monks never rely solely on the need to have a weapon in their hands to defend against their enemies. Although most widely known to the outside world for their fearsome jabs and flying kicks, they refuse to limit themselves to a single method of combat. Many monks prefer instead to “soak it up” and seem to revel in the intoxicating effect of absorbing blow after blow while their companions press the attack. Other monks specialize in calling upon the restorative power of the mists to balance the good and bad energy within people, returning them to good health and fortune.
            <br><br>
            Monks bring a unique martial arts style to any fight, and harness an exotic form of magical energy that’s unfamiliar to those who practice other arcane arts. They seek spiritual balance in life and in combat, and as dangerous as Monks can be on the battlefield, they’re rarely looking to pick a fight without just cause. They view the world through a different lens, finding power through serenity and inner peace—then expressing it through artful combat techniques and powers that mend life. Perhaps most surprisingly, Monks are also adept at producing powerful brews they consume to aid them in battle.</p>
    <h6 class="druid_text">Druid <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/Druid_Crest.webp')}}" alt="Druid Logo"></h6>
        <h4>Roles: <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/tank.webp')}}" alt="">Tank, <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/dps.webp')}}" alt=""> DPS, <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/healer.webp')}}" alt="">Healer</h4>
            <p>Guardians of nature who seek to preserve balance and protect life, Druids have unmatched versatility on the field of battle. This is in part because druidism is much more than a fighting discipline—it’s a way of life steeped in traditions so ancient that even the origin of their kind is preserved largely in mythology passed on through millennia.
            <br><br>
            Druids harness nature’s raw energy for an incredible breadth of offensive and defensive abilities, as well as to restore life to the wounded. Through communion with nature and the demigod Cenarius, Lord of the Forest, Druids are supernaturally endowed with the gift of shapeshifting, allowing them to take the form of all manner of nature’s creature and access powers as distinct as they are diverse.</p>
    <h6 class="demonhunter_text">Demon Hunter <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/Demon_Hunter_Crest.webp')}}" alt="Demon Hunter Logo"></h6>
        <h4>Roles: <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/tank.webp')}}" alt="">Tank, <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/dps.webp')}}" alt=""> DPS</h4>
            <p>Demon hunters, disciples of Illidan Stormrage, uphold a dark legacy, one that frightens their allies and enemies alike. The Illidari embrace fel and chaotic magics—energies that have long threatened the world of Azeroth—believing them necessary to challenge the Burning Legion. Wielding the powers of demons they’ve slain, they develop demonic features that incite revulsion and dread in fellow elves.</p>
    <h6 class="deathknight_text">Death Knight <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/Death_Knight_Crest.webp')}}" alt="Death Knight Logo"></h6>
        <h4>Roles: <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/tank.webp')}}" alt="">Tank, <img class="logo-race" src="{{url_for('static',filename = 'images/dps.webp')}}" alt=""> DPS</h4>
            <p>When the Lich King’s control of his death knights was broken, his former champions sought revenge for the horrors committed under his command. After their vengeance was won, the death knights found themselves without a cause and without a home. One by one they trickled into the land of the living in search of a new purpose. Frost sharpens their strikes; blood fortifies their bodies; and undeath allows them to erupt in unholy rage in the heat of battle. A thousand atrocities are etched in the eyes of every death knight, and foes who gaze into them too long will feel the warmth pulled from their bodies, replaced with cold steel.</p>
